# Use Azure OpenAI APIs in your app

With the Azure OpenAI Service, developers can create chatbots, language models, and other applications that excel at understanding natural human language. The Azure OpenAI provides access to pre-trained AI models, as well as a suite of APIs and tools for customizing and fine-tuning these models to meet the specific requirements of your application. In this exercise, you'll learn how to deploy a model in Azure OpenAI and use it in your own application.

In the scenario for this exercise, you will perform the role of a software developer who has been tasked to implement an app that can use generative AI to help provide hiking recommendations. The techniques used in the exercise can be applied to any app that wants to use Azure OpenAI APIs.

This exercise will take approximately **30** minutes.



## Deploy a model (Ignore if you have already created)

Azure OpenAI provides a web-based portal named **Azure OpenAI Studio**, that you can use to deploy, manage, and explore models. You'll start your exploration of Azure OpenAI by using Azure OpenAI Studio to deploy a model.

1. On the **Overview** page for your Azure OpenAI resource, use the **Go to Azure OpenAI Studio** button to open Azure OpenAI Studio in a new browser tab.
2. In Azure OpenAI Studio, on the **Deployments** page, view your existing model deployments. If you don't already have one, create a new deployment of the **gpt-35-turbo-16k** model with the following settings:
    - **Model**: gpt-35-turbo-16k
    - **Model version**: Auto-update to default
    - **Deployment name**: *A unique name of your choice. You'll use this name later in the lab.*
    - **Advanced options**
        - **Content filter**: Default
        - **Deployment type**: Standard
        - **Tokens per minute rate limit**: 5K\*
        - **Enable dynamic quota**: Enabled

    > \* A rate limit of 5,000 tokens per minute is more than adequate to complete this exercise while leaving capacity for other people using the same subscription.


## Configure and run your application (You can use Google Colab) to work with the notebook


1. Open the notebook chatcompletions.ipynb and replace the following values with your OpenAI model values in the application.
        (your_azure_oai_endpoint)
        (your_azure_oai_key)
        (your_azure_oai_deployment)

2. Execute the notebook after making the changes and observe the output.

    

## Clean up

When you're done with your Azure OpenAI resource, remember to delete the deployment or the entire resource in the **Azure portal** at `https://portal.azure.com`.
